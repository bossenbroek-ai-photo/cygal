# Cygal
Cygal is an application using SvelteJs Kit and Typescript for the frontend.

## Packaging set-up
It uses pre-commit hooks to automatically point out issues in code such as trailing whitespace and debug statements.
By pointing these issues out before code review, we hope this will allow a code reviewer to focus on the architecture of a change while not wasting time with trivial style nitpicks.

### Pre-requisites
* npm - `npm install -g`
* Node version >= v16.7.0

### Setup
Install pre-commit and set-up hooks.

```bash
$ pipx install pre-commit
  installed package pre-commit 2.19.0, installed using Python 3.10.4
  These apps are now globally available
    - pre-commit
    - pre-commit-validate-config
    - pre-commit-validate-manifest
done! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨
```

Then run,

```bash
$ pre-commit install --install-hooks
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
