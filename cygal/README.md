# Cygal - Frontend

# create-svelte

This project is built using [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing

The dependencies should already be installed when you clone the project. If not, run `npm install` before starting a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## Development process

Before files commit, make sure to run `pre-commit run --all-files` - this will fix your errors before you commit.
