    'Anton Bossenbroek (b. 1980) is a Dutch / French photographer and entrepreneur based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. He started his photo career after spending years in corporate life working in artificial intelligence and data science. In his work, he seeks to connect our virtual world to the real world. He looks for obvious and less apparent clues. Drawing inspiration from the abstract and impressionist photography movements to play with structures, patterns, tonalities and subtle details, I seek to explore the dichotomy of the ever-expanding virtual world and the ephemerality of our physical world.';
